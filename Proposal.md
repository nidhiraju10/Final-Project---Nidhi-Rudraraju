# My Project Proposal 
# For my final project I plan to build a running journal web application where the user can enter the start and end location, time and they will also be able to enter text to describe how the workout went and they are able to share details from the trip that they would like to journal! Once the user enters all the details this is all saved in a CSV file that is connected to the app and the web app will create a page of the journal that will show the map of the route and how long it took and it also will display the description that the user has entered. If I am able to scale this project I also would like to let the user upload images and videos to the journal as well .
